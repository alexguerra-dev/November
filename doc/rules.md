## Turn Sequence

The dice pass **clockwise**. On your turn:

1. Roll **all five dice**.
2. If there are **no scoring dice**, your turn ends immediately with **0 points** (this is called a _brick_).
3. If **all five dice** are scoring, you must roll all five again, but your points carry over.
   - Beware: if the reroll produces no scoring dice, you lose all points for that turn.
4. After any successful roll, you may choose to:
   - **Stop** and bank your accumulated points.
   - **Continue rolling**, but you must ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù at least one scoring set from the previous roll.
   - Frozen sets remain locked until the turn ends.

- **Three of a Kind**

  - `Three 1s` ‚Üí 1000 points
  - `Three of any other number` ‚Üí Face value √ó 100
    - e.g. `Three 5s` = 500 points, `Three 3s` = 300 points

- **Straights**

  - `1,2,3,4,5` or `2,3,4,5,6` (rolled all at once) ‚Üí 1500 points

  - She scores 150 points (100 for the `1`, 50 for the `5`)
  - She decides to reroll the `2, 2, 3`.

- Next roll: `2, 5, 5`
  - She scores 100 points (two `5s`)
  - Total so far: 250 points.
  - Alice stops here and banks 250 points.

If she had rerolled and gotten no scoring dice, she would have **bricked** and lost everything for that turn.
