# November ðŸŽ²

A five-dice game of risk, reward, and strategy built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## About the Game

November is a dice game where players race to accumulate points by rolling scoring combinations. The game blends luck with risk management â€” do you stop and bank your points, or keep rolling for more?

### Game Rules

- **Goal:** Be the first player to reach 5,000 points
- **Scoring:**
  - Single 1 = 100 points
  - Single 5 = 50 points
  - Three of a kind = face value Ã— 100 (Three 1s = 1000)
  - Straights (1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6) = 1500 points
  - Five 1s = 5000 points (instant win!)

### How to Play

1. Roll all five dice
2. Freeze scoring dice and reroll the rest
3. Bank your points or keep rolling (but risk losing everything!)
4. If you roll no scoring dice, you lose your turn score
